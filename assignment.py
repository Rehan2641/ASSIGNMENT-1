Subtraction = a-b

# Multiplication
Multiplication = a*b

# Division
Division = a/b


# 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

#2.Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name.

full_name = (first_name+' '+last_name)

# 3.  Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.
